# Deep Convolutional GANs

A NNabla implementation of the paper ["Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional
Generative Adversarial Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00677).

## MNIST

You can find DCGANs for MNIST image generation in [MNIST collection examples](https://github.com/sony/nnabla-examples/tree/master/mnist-collection#deep-convolutional-gan-dcganpy).
